# Heilungsspiel
This was a small experiment well outside my area of expertise. I learned that many patients who suffer from brain injury or illness experience temporary, but substantial, losses in cognition. This can be some combination of difficulty with fine motor control, with focus, and with recall -- making new memories or accessing old ones. Fortunately, there are Occupational Therapy options that can help speed up recovery. 

An idea came to me for a music-making tool that would give these patients another way to work on dexterity and concentration. I had in mind a user who may or may not have any musical know-how or internet access. The Heilungsspiel is an extremely simple, virtual Glockenspiel, which can run in the browser from a local file(s).

Preliminary signs suggest it may actually help as intended. Users seem also to share a tendency to memorize songs, which seems like a good way to work on memory-making and recall.

Thanks are owed to Dr. BH, who encouraged me to try this, and to my friend and German translator, Johannes Hafner, who explained the subtle meanings of various -spiel words.
